# Contributing

Small, correct, test-covered changes are preferred over sweeping rewrites.

## Ground rules

- Python >= 3.11. Runtime dependencies are constrained in `pyproject.toml`;
  adding a new one needs a justification in the PR description.
- 100% branch coverage is enforced in CI. Every new branch needs a direct
  test assertion.
- Testnet-first safety defaults are load-bearing. A change that flips
  `testnet=True` or `dry_run=True` as a default is a contract break and must be
  flagged explicitly in the PR.
- Never commit secrets. `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and the project configs
  are stored under `~/.config/simple_ai_trading/` (mode 0600)
  at runtime.
- The local CLI reads environment variables from the process environment; it
  does not auto-load `.env`. Docker Compose may read `.env` and pass listed
  values through `docker-compose.yml`.

## Local workflow

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/pip install pytest coverage ruff mypy

# Tests + coverage gate
.venv/bin/python -m coverage run --source=src/simple_ai_trading --branch -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m coverage report --fail-under=100

# Static checks on touched files
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests
.venv/bin/ruff format --check src tests
.venv/bin/mypy src
```

On Windows, use Python 3.11 for launcher smoke checks:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv311
.\.venv311\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
.\run-shell.cmd --help
.\run-gui.cmd --help
```

## Commit etiquette

- One logical change per commit. Tests first (or alongside) the code.
- Subject line in imperative mood (`add`, `fix`, `refactor`), <= 72 chars.
- Body explains the *why* when it is non-obvious; the code already says the
  *what*.

## Pushing

If you need to push with a Personal Access Token, use the helper:

```bash
python3 tools/push_with_pat.py origin my-branch
```

The helper serves your PAT to `git push` over a short-lived UNIX socket so it
never appears in `argv`, remotes, logs, shell history, or long-lived credential
stores.
