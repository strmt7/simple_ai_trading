# Model Research and Optimization

This document records the model direction implemented for the `0.1.0-beta.1`
revamp. The goal is autonomous multi-asset day trading with fail-closed risk
gates, not a promise of guaranteed profit.

## Research Inputs

- TradingView Pine built-ins and public indicator conventions were used as
  conceptual references for common technical features such as RSI, EMA, ATR,
  volume, trend, and volatility:
  <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/>
- The public Lorentzian Classification indicator inspired the Lorentzian
  nearest-neighbor expert. No Pine source was copied:
  <https://www.tradingview.com/script/WhBzgfDu-Machine-Learning-Lorentzian-Classification/>
- The public Nadaraya-Watson rational quadratic kernel indicator inspired the
  smooth kernel-regression expert. No Pine source was copied:
  <https://www.tradingview.com/script/AWNvbPRM-Nadaraya-Watson-Rational-Quadratic-Kernel-Non-Repainting/>
- Freqtrade Hyperopt and Protections influenced the separation between
  optimization, cooldowns, stop guards, and drawdown gates:
  <https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/hyperopt/> and
  <https://www.freqtrade.io/en/2024.1/includes/protections/>
- Triple-barrier labeling, event-driven sampling, and purged validation were
  used as training inspiration so labels match stop/take economics instead of
  only future-close direction:

- Microsoft DirectML was selected for the Windows-first GPU path because it
  supports DirectX 12 GPUs across AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel on Windows:
  <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/pytorch-windows>
- Binance market-data endpoints are used for automatic universe ranking instead
  of static symbol allowlists:

## Implemented Model Zoo

The base classifier remains the advanced logistic/GPU training path already
used by the CLI. The revamp adds a hybrid expert layer stored directly inside
the serialized model:

- `lorentzian_knn`: balanced long/short prototypes selected from chronological
  training rows, scored with Lorentzian distance.
- `rational_quadratic_kernel`: kernel-regression vote over the same prototype
  set, with tunable alpha and length scale.
- `technical_confluence`: deterministic market-regime confluence using the
  existing feature vector for trend, volatility, volume, and mean-reversion.

The optimizer evaluates risk-level-specific weight profiles:

- `conservative`: favors base-model agreement, smoother kernels, and smaller
  expert overrides.
- `regular`: balances base probability, Lorentzian neighbor structure, kernel
  smoothness, and confluence.
- `aggressive`: allows stronger expert contribution, but still has to pass
  backtest gates and drawdown limits.

The training-suite grid deliberately includes lower threshold probes, multiple
label target/horizon profiles, and both forward-return and stop/take-aware
triple-barrier labels for every risk level. This prevents high-confidence-only,
single-horizon, or direction-only candidates from being rejected only because
they never trade or because the label rewards moves that cannot survive fees,
spread, stop losses, and take-profit geometry. The objective gates still require
positive P&L, sufficient closed trades, buy-and-hold edge, and drawdown
discipline. Rejected model-lab candidates now include per-window `reject_reason`
diagnostics so operators can distinguish missing trade count, negative P&L,
buy-and-hold edge failure, drawdown failure, and stopped-by-drawdown failures.

For futures, threshold calibration stores the same effective neutral-band
threshold used by live and backtest direction logic: values below `0.5` are not
persisted as futures decision thresholds because long/short futures signals use
`score >= threshold` for long and `score <= 1 - threshold` for short.

After the broad grid is ranked, local refinement also tests tighter and wider
exit geometry around the best candidate, including lower take-profit variants
that can close more intraday positions when the first pass fails trade-count
or buy-and-hold edge gates.

Accepted hybrid candidates must improve or preserve the objective score and pass
the profitability, drawdown, and minimum-trade gates in
`ObjectiveSpec.accepts`. If no base candidate survives the hard gates, the
training suite now attempts a small fail-closed hybrid rescue pass over the top
rejected base candidates. A rescued hybrid is serialized only when it passes the
hybrid selection window, the final chronological holdout, and the full-sample
objective gates; otherwise the objective remains rejected.

## Cross-Symbol Model Lab

`simple-ai-trading model-lab` is the iterative optimization workflow. It:

1. Pulls exchange metadata, 24h tickers, and book tickers.
2. Automatically ranks high-liquidity symbols using quote volume, trade count,
   bid/ask spread, exchange status, and quote-asset policy.
3. Fetches recent klines for each ranked symbol.
4. Runs the training suite and hybrid optimizer for one or more objectives.
5. Requires the selected candidate to pass purged chronological walk-forward
   folds before serialization. The purge gap protects against label-lookahead
   leakage between train and test folds.
6. Replays every saved objective model under mandatory symbol-specific stress:
   baseline measured execution, wider spread/slippage, latency spike with a
   liquidity haircut, and combined liquidity crunch with fee/spread/latency
   stress.
7. Writes a JSON report plus per-symbol `stress_validation.json` and marks an
   outcome accepted only when all objective scores are positive and every stress
   replay passes the objective risk gates.

This is deliberately fail-closed. If live testnet data cannot produce a
profitable, diversified, risk-bounded candidate, the report should reject the
candidate instead of forcing a trade.

## SuperZip Windows-App Alignment

The Windows app follows the SuperZip design direction:

- Native C++20 Win32 app instead of Tkinter.
- PowerShell build script that discovers Visual Studio, CMake, Ninja, and
  Python.
- Double-buffered GDI rendering with Segoe UI fonts and DWM dark caption colors.
- Generated command contract from the Python CLI so the GUI command list cannot
  drift from CLI capabilities.
- Explicit smoke/build tests rather than manual launch assumptions.

The app is intentionally an operator console over the exact CLI contract. New
workflow parity must be added to the Python parser first; then
`tools/generate_windows_contract.py` regenerates the native header and tests
assert that every CLI command appears in the Windows app.

## Non-Negotiable Gates

- No static list of approved symbols. Liquidity must be measured from exchange
  data.
- No mainnet trading by default.
- No leverage above 10x.
- No AI in CPU-only mode.
- No non-profitable accepted model-lab outcome.
- No selected training-suite model without purged walk-forward evidence when
  enough rows are available.
- No single-scenario-only model-lab acceptance.
- No Windows-app-only workflow.
- No CLI-only workflow.
- Stop/pause controls must remain visible and tested.
