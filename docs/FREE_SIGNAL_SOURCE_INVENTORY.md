# Free Signal Source Inventory for BTCUSDC

Last checked: 2026-04-29.

This inventory is historical input for the current BTC/ETH/SOL-only testnet-first day-trading app. It
intentionally separates exchange execution from external signal ingestion. A
source appearing here is not a trading recommendation and does not mean it
should be added to live order flow without caching, validation, and tests.

## Integration Rules

1. Keep Binance execution isolated. External sources may enrich features,
   backtests, reports, and veto/risk flags, but they should not bypass the
   BTC/ETH/SOL-only, high-liquidity, testnet-first contracts.
2. Prefer no-key or generous official APIs first. Keyed free tiers are allowed
   for offline enrichment, but runtime must keep missing keys non-fatal.
3. Cache every external source. Recommended minimum TTLs are listed below; do
   not call social/news/macro endpoints once per live tick.
4. Store source metadata with artifacts: provider, endpoint family, timestamp,
   freshness, and whether the value came from a keyless, keyed, or unofficial
   endpoint.
5. Treat vendor limits as volatile. The table records the limits checked on
   2026-04-28; rate-limit code must still read response headers and back off.
6. Never train on rows that contain future information. Event/news/macro
   values must be joined only by the timestamp at which the signal was known.

## Highest Value First

These sources should be considered before broader integration work because
they are high-signal, cheap, and fit the current repo shape.

| Priority | Source | Auth / free tier | Candidate feature | Cadence | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Source Matrix

### Exchange And Market Microstructure

| Source | Auth / limits checked | Relevant endpoints or feeds | Signal value | Suggested use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binance Spot REST | No key for market data. Official docs expose `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-*` headers and require backoff on 429/418. | `/api/v3/klines`, `/ticker/24hr`, `/ticker/bookTicker`, `/exchangeInfo` | Native symbol candles, L1 spread, volume, symbol filters. | Already core. Add spread/volume features and persist request weight. |

## Implementation Backlog

Implemented in this prototype:

- `data-sync` stores Binance closed candles, 24h ticker, raw L1 book ticker,
  normalized top-of-book spread/depth snapshots, USD-M premium index, open
  interest, and funding history in SQLite with the existing rate-limited
  Binance client.
- `signals` and `live --external-signals` cache and blend Alternative.me,
  CoinGecko, Binance futures positioning, and mempool.space into a bounded
  score/risk adjustment with provider quorum checks.
- `train --source auto|db --download-missing` can train from the SQLite store
  and prompt for a missing backfill when the selected interval lacks enough
  rows.

Remaining backlog:

1. Add a source registry module with provider name, endpoint family, TTL,
   auth mode, and parser contract.
2. Persist non-Binance raw provider snapshots under `data/signals/<provider>/YYYYMMDD/`
   with atomic writes and redacted config metadata.
3. Build a timestamp-safe joiner that only uses values whose `known_at_ms` is
   at or before the candle close time.
4. Add offline feature columns behind explicit feature names. Keep them disabled
   by default until backtest coverage exists.
5. Add richer `signals` subcommands for per-provider freshness, cache paths,
   and any rate-limit/backoff events.
6. Only after offline tests pass, allow `backtest` to read cached
   external features. Runtime should never block on a slow news/social API.
